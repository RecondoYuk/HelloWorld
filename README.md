A repository for the first solo project exercise in "Github for Dummies"

## Update
I started this book back in 2021 and then got distracted like I usually do with my **ADHD** until I finally came back to it in May of 2022.  

At that point it asked me to put a headshot in here but I didn't want to go through the hassled of finding a headshot so instead I used a copy of the "Pillars of Creation" photo.

##### To Add Headshot
Click on the pencil above the **README.md** file and add the following line:
