## Update
I started this book back in 2021 and then got distracted like I usually do with my **ADHD** until I finally came back to it in May of 2022.  

At that point it asked me to put a headshot in here but I didn't want to go through the hassled of finding a headshot so instead I used a copy of the "Pillars of Creation" photo.

##### To Add Headshot
Click on the pencil above the **README.md** file and add the following line:

## Favorite Books ##
Obviously I will swear by any book in the *Discworld Series* by Terry Pratchett.  First and foremost.  *Ender's Game* comes in a close second.
After that I have a few:  
 * Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
 * The Regiment
 * The Brotherhood of War series
 * The Dresden Series
 * The Guns of the South  


Really, just far too many.
